/**
 * The problem with AtomicLong impl is that AtomicLongs, in Hazelcast, is not bound to the CP Session nor they have a lease time.
 * This may create problems because:
 * - no client session: if the lock holder crashes the long value of 1 stays there forever (it's a lock leak)
 * - no lease: if you forget to unlock, it never releases the lock
 * And, there's no fencing, so it may be that if client1 holds the lock and then it's delayed, over the cap,
 * then the lock is released by the system. Now client2 acquires the lock. If client1 wakes up it still thinks
 * he has the lock and can access resources whilst client2 has the lock creating a data corruption problem.
 *
 * The issue with the IMap implementation simulating unowned lock is that IMap locks are data-partition locks (AP),
 * thread/caller-owned, and not CP/linearizable.
 * Using forceUnlock() bypasses ownership checks and introduces races under load as your test shows
 * You'll also have problems because there's no lease so this may create leaks
 *
 * With ISemaphore from the CP system (see https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/javadoc/com/hazelcast/cp/ISemaphore.html) set with 1 permit only:
 * - the acquire/release is agreed by all members of the CP subsystem
 * - it is session-aware so
 *   - clients within the same session can lock/unlock; this includes two distinct threads within the same client application
 *   - if a client holding a lock dies, the session is cleared and locks automatically released
 * - lineariazbility is guaranteed via RAFT so under load mutual exclusion is guaranteed
 *
 * two threads in the same client application belong to the same session so it's the app's responsibility to correcly program locks/unlocks
 *
 * two clients connected to the same CP subsystem (ie distinct hazelcast clients) form two distinct CP sessions:
 * - clientA acquires (CP knows that A holds 1 permit)
 * - A dies and CP reclaims lock
 * - clientB acquires lock (only B session can release)
 * - if A later calls release() CP rejects it
 *
